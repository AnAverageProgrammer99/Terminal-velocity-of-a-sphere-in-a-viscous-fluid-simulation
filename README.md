# Terminal-velocity-of-a-sphere-in-a-viscous-fluid-simulation
Made this for a physics project at school. Includes a nice (if not basic) visualization of what is happening using pygame. 

Libraries to install:
Numpy
Matplotlib
Pygame

All can be installed using "pip install <library name>" in the command line
  

Disclaimer:
  
  This is a very basic program and isnt very efficient in any sense of the word but it will work and you can easily add new sphere materials and fluids
  if you want to see what happens in each situation
 
  This also only works with Newton Regime (K values between 43.3 and 2360), this means it will not work for extremely small objects
